### Structure
**input/fsh/*.fsh** files are logically grouped into folders, which are used to generate the website structure. 
Please follow the same structure when adding new files.

**input/pagecontent** folder contains markdown files which are used to generate the website pages.
Menu and page name mappings are defined in **sushi-config.yaml** file.
